In this project, we can order pizza through the website. There is an option to add pizza ingredients in quantities, i.e. you can change the quantity of ingredients yourself. There are three main buttons on the main page: Save pizza, Load pizza and checkout pizza. Each of them performs function defined
First: when you click on the save button, the pizza ingredients are saved and a unique code is given that saves the pizza ingredients.
Second: when you click on the download button, a modal window opens in which you need to enter a unique code that we received from the "Save pizza" button and get the ingredients from the unique code
Third: when you click on the Check button, a modal window opens in which information is given about the pizza and ingredients that you have chosen and by clicking next on this modal window you are directed to the order page where you must enter information about yourself (address, email, delivery method, etc. )
